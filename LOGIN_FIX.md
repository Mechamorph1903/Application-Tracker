## Quick Login Fix

Your login issue is likely due to password hash changes during migration.

### SOLUTION 1: Reset Your Password

1. **Start your Flask app** first:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

2. **Go to the registration page** in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/register
   ```

3. **Register with the same email** but a slightly different username (like `DozieX2`)

4. **Or use the password reset** if we implement it

### SOLUTION 2: Manual Database Fix

Run this command to reset your password:

```cmd
python -c "from app import create_app; from app.models import db, User; app = create_app(); ctx = app.app_context(); ctx.push(); user = User.query.filter_by(username='DozieX').first(); user.set_password('newpassword123') if user else print('User not found'); db.session.commit() if user else None; print('Password reset!') if user else None; ctx.pop()"
```

### SOLUTION 3: Create New Account

Your data (internships) are still there, so you can:
1. Create a new account
2. We can transfer the internships to the new account

### Current Login Credentials

Try these first:
- **Username**: `DozieX`
- **Email**: `danielanorue@gmail.com`
- **Password**: Try your original password

If that doesn't work, let me know and I'll fix it immediately!
